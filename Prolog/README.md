## Installation and Executon:



## Description of the game:
In the solitary version of this game, the player must fill in two grids with Os and Xs without making a line or a square of the four same symbol. But the two grids are connected: by putting a symbol in one grid, you also put it somewhere else in the other grid.

Using the same mechanism, the multiplayer version is about the players trying to have less lines and squares in their grids than their opponents.


## Considerations for game extensions:
The size of the board varies depending on the number of players the user wants. For single-player games we have a 6x6 board, on the other hand you can play with a 4x4 or 5x5 if it's difficult. In the case of multiplayer, as many boards as the number of players are given, these being 8x8


## Game Logic:
### Game Configuration Representation:



### Internal Game State Representation:



### Move Representation:



### User Interaction:



## Conclusions:
During this project, we were able to apply the knowledge we had acquired in class, from the menu to the dynamics of the game.

The game allows us to play single player, multiplayer for 2 or 3 people. We also implemented the option of player vs. pc and pc vs. pc
