## Installation and Executon:



## Description of the game:
In the solitary version of this game, the player must fill in two grids with Os and Xs without making a line or a square of the four same symbol. But the two grids are connected: by putting a symbol in one grid, you also put it somewhere else in the other grid.

Using the same mechanism, the multiplayer version is about the players trying to have less lines and squares in their grids than their opponents.


## Considerations for game extensions:



## Game Logic:
### Game Configuration:



### Internal Game State Representation:



### Move Representation:



### User Interaction:



## Conclusions:
During the course of this project, we were able to apply the knowledge we had acquired in class, from the menu to the dynamics of the game.

The game allows you to play with 1, 2 or 3 players.

We haven't implemented the game of one person against the computer
